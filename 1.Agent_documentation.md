# Multi agent voice conversation system

The task is about a conversation or an interaction with the agents about diverse topics. 

Here, in my project, I used 3 agents:

1. Realist agent : Well grounded and relies on facts.

   Personality :

   - Focuses on facts and logic.
   - Rational thinking over emotions.
   - Often uses web search or external tools to get information.

2. Optimistic agent : Very positive and optimistic to the user's query.

   Personality :

   - Supportive and warm.
   - Encourages with positive reinforcement.
   - Listens and responds with empathy.

3. Planner agent : Great planner irrespective of the theme of the query. It also acts as an expert agent at the end to combine the state and give the final output.

   Personality :

   - Creates timelines, roadmaps and study plans.
   - Prioritizes the task.
   - Can shift into expert mode when needed(eg : gives tips and recommendations).
  
Overall, the system adapts well with the user, topics and even with the tools and conditions.

**Prompt Engineering techniques:**

1. Role based prompting - defines the personas of the agents.

2. Few shot - by giving the structure to follow.

3. Contextual prompting - Used to access the context like {web_context}, {history}, etc.

4. Instruction based prompting : Directly instructed the purpose or goal.

Prompts used in the project can be referred in "CODE/prompts.py"
